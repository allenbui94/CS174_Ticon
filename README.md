# CS174 Ticon
This is a group project for CS 174. We're working on a online shopping website for clothes... but it's only a simulation. ONLY. A SIMULATION.

Group members:
* Allen Bui ([allenbui94](https://github.com/allenbui94)) - just kinda organized stuff...
* Sridivya Kondapalli ([jardinargent](https://github.com/jardinargent)) - did most of the front end
* Daniel Li ([akina1051](https://github.com/akina1051)) - made some funny banners
* Edwin Tseng ([etsan](https://github.com/etsan)) - did most of the work

## Templates
We shamelessly grabbed lots of stuff online. Thanks to:
* Start Bootstrap
